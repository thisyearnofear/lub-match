# DEVELOPMENT NOTES
# =============================================================================

# Quick Share Mode:
# - Uses your PINATA_JWT for app-controlled storage
# - Content is permanent and managed by the app
# - Perfect for viral social sharing on Farcaster
# - Users warned about permanence

# Private Control Mode:
# - Users provide their own Pinata API key
# - They maintain full control and can delete content
# - Better for sensitive/personal content
# - Requires users to have Pinata account

# For development without Pinata:
# - Leave PINATA_JWT empty
# - App will use mock CIDs for testing
# - Game creation will work but files won't be stored

# For development without Neynar:
# - Leave NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_API_KEY empty
# - App will use mock Farcaster user data
# - Social features will work with placeholder data

# For development without WalletConnect:
# - Leave NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID empty
# - App will use fallback project ID
# - May see API warnings in console (safe to ignore)

# Security Notes:
# - Never commit real API keys to version control
# - Use different Pinata accounts for staging vs production
# - Monitor Pinata usage and costs
# - Consider rate limiting for production deployment
