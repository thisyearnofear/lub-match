# 🚀 Lub Match: Project Overview

## 📋 Executive Summary

Lub Match is evolving from a romantic memory game into a viral social gaming platform. By enhancing the existing Farcaster integration with an AI-powered challenge system and "whale harpooning" mechanics, we are creating a dynamic, engaging, and rewarding experience for all users. The core innovation lies in allowing users to set AI-generated challenges for other Farcaster users, creating viral loops and rewarding both challengers and targets.
