# 🎯 Lub Match Product Roadmap

## 🎮 Core Strategy: Dual-Path Social + Romance

### **Unified Experience Design**
- **Single UX/Design System**: "Send lub" works for friends AND lovers
- **Consistent Flows**: Demo → Social Games, Custom → Proposal
- **Ambiguous & Fun**: Intentionally playful language that works for all relationships
- **No Backend**: Smart contracts + IPFS for simplicity and decentralization

### **User Journey Architecture**
```
Landing → Demo Game → Social Games Hub → Create Lub
                                            ├── Farcaster Mode (Hold LUB)
                                            └── Romance Mode (Spend LUB)
```

## 💰 Token Economics & Anti-Spam Strategy

### **LUB Token Supply & Distribution**
- **Total Supply**: 10 billion LUB tokens
- **Initial Distribution**: TBD (team, community, rewards pool)
- **Utility**: Game creation, NFT minting, rewards

### **Pricing Strategy**
| Action | Cost | Mechanism | Purpose |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| First Lub (any type) | FREE | One-time | Onboarding |
| Farcaster Lubs | Hold 50 LUB | Stake requirement | Viral growth + spam prevention |
| Romance Lubs | Spend 10/25/50+ LUB | Progressive cost | Revenue + quality control |
| NFT Minting | ETH or 50% discount with LUB | Hybrid payment | Revenue + LUB utility |

### **LUB Acquisition Methods**
- **Earn**: 10 LUB when photos used in games
- **Earn**: 5 LUB for social game completions  
- **Earn**: 25 LUB for successful referrals
- **Buy**: Credit card → LUB onramp
- **Buy**: DEX trading for crypto users
