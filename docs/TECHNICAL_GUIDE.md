    ```bash
    pnpm install
    pnpm test
    pnpm build
    pnpm start
    ```
2.  **Deploy to Vercel**:
    ```bash
    vercel --prod
    ```

## ðŸ§¹ Code Cleanup & Architecture

After implementing the AI Challenge System, we performed an aggressive consolidation to eliminate duplicate code and maintain a clean architecture.

### Code Removed

- **`socialInteractionService.ts`**: Removed ~150 lines of duplicate code related to challenge creation, completion, and retrieval.
- **`viralDetectionService.ts`**: Removed ~30 lines of duplicate code related to content validation.

### Current Service Architecture

- **`challengeEngine.ts`**: AI-powered challenge generation, lifecycle management, and reward calculation.
- **`viralDetectionService.ts`**: Viral content pattern detection, confidence scoring, and verification.
- **`antiSpamService.ts`**: Content quality validation, rate limiting, and user reputation management.
- **`socialInteractionService.ts`**: Interaction tracking and analytics.

### Benefits of Cleanup

- **Development Efficiency**: Faster development, easier debugging, and reduced complexity.
- **Maintenance**: Single source of truth for each feature, making updates easier and testing more focused.
- **Performance**: Reduced memory usage and faster execution.
